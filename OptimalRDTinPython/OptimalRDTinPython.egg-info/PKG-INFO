Description: # OptimalRDT Package
        This package implements several advances in reliability demonstration test (RDT) design. 
        
        - Multi-state RDT considering multiple test periods (Multi_State_I) and multiple failure modes (Multi_State_II). 
        - RDT design considering acceptance decision uncertainty. 
        - RDT design considering trade-offs from multiple objectives.
        
        Version Updateï¼š
        ------
        ### Version 0.1.0
        - Build classes of basic elements for optimal RDT design (e.g., Prior, Indicator, Core)
        > Core is used to compute likelihood of failure probability, currently for multi-state RDT are built for two states (e.g., two periods, two failure modes)
        
        ### Version 0.2.0
        - Build classes of different risk criteria (e.g, Consumer_Risk, Producer_Risk, Acceptance_Prob)
        > Risk criteria for multi-state RDT are built for two states (e.g., two periods, two failure modes)
        
        ### Version 0.3.0
        - Build classes of finding optimal RDT plan  based on minimum sample size(e.g., Optimal_Sample_Size)
        
        ### Version 0.4.0
        - Build classes of Cost (e.g, RDT cost, warranty cost, reliability growth cost, expected overall cost)
        > Expected cost is built only for Binomial RDT
        
        - Build classes of finding optimal RDT plan  based on minimum cost and acceptance uncertainty(e.g., Optimal_Cost)
        > Optimal_Cost is built only for Binomial RDT
